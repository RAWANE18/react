# React + Vite
### Debugging Process for Sample React Application

- **Issue Identified**: Counter component not incrementing.
- **Diagnosis**: State was not updating due to incorrect use of the state setter function.
- **Fix Implemented**: Updated the state setter to correctly increment the counter.
  ```javascript
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };
